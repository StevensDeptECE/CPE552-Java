A class is a specification to create AN OBJECT
A class can be INSTANTIATED

An abstract class CANNOT BE INSTANTIATED

   an abstract class has an abstract method, and since you don't know what to do
   you cannot call it: shape.draw()


An interface is an abstract class without:
   data
   methods

the only thing in an interface is abstract methods

public interface ActionListener {
  public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e);
}

notice: NO WORD ABSTRACT in interface, because EVERYTHING IS ABSTRACT
