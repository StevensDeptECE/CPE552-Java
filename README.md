# EE552-Java

Instructor: Dov Kruger

Welcome to EE552, an intensive introduction to Java.

Session01 to Session03 are in Processing.  After that we switch to
Java.  I have started using Netbeans for everything, but you are
strongly encouraged to use Eclipse as well so that you learn how each
tool works.
